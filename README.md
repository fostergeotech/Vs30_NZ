# New Zealand Vs30 mapping

VERSION 18.12  -  Published version (Earthquake Spectra - submitted 12/2018)

All codes have hardcoded working directory information. Other users will need to edit working directory strings accordingly. Unless indicated otherwise (in a few scripts), ~/VsMap/ is the working directory.

This codebase is not a "one-click" operation but interested users should be able to make use of most/parts of it. Please contact me with questions.

## Organization

R files contained in `R/` represent the vast bulk of research workflow. Some image processing tasks and other miscellaneous tasks are done by shell scripts in `VsMap/sh/`. Important scripts are highlighted here, roughly in the order in which they need to be run for the published modeling workflow:

 | File                                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

 |  `sh/makeFigs.sh                                `      |  Same as above, for a few specialized figures, e.g. the "six-pane" figures used for overview of generating geology- and terrain-based models.                                                                                                                                                       |
 |  `sh/convert-final-maps--make-prj-files.sh      `      |  Produce standalone GIS projection metadata files to be distributed alongside final maps (because maps are in a NZ projection---NZGD00, aka EPSG:2193---and some users have reported difficulty importing the GeoTIFF files without this supplemental metadata).                                    |

Other folders:
  * Rdata files are written in `VsMap/Rdata`
      * `vspr.Rdata` velocity data input, saved as `spatialPointsDataFrame` (dataframe object with spatial coordinates as provided by package `sp`)
      * variogram_*.Rdata` various variogram objects saved as `variogramModel` object as provided by package `gstat`
  * `VsMap/out` contains output files: includes (among others)
      * scatter plots, histograms, etc. used for assessing model and most figures included in Earthquake Spectra draft.
      * PNG files containing colored maps with hillshades, legends, etc as shown in submitted Earthquake Spectra manuscript.
  * Some (mostly larger) files are saved in ~/big_noDB folder. These are big input files, either DEM (digital elevation model) or the QMAP (geology map), or various intermediate rasters derived from these (e.g. Iwahashi & Pike style terrain maps).
  * Most input data is included in `VsMap/in` folder. This includes Vs30 input data, some versions of geologic map, etc.
  * `Vs30_tables` contains auto-generated tables with various subsets of the collection of input Vs30 data. This table is created by `vspr_write.R` following the import of Vs30 data and the application of various sorting, overlay and model tasks. These were useful in assessing the performance of text search scripts used to parse geology map metadata and assign simplified geologic categories.

## Dependencies

Developed on a multiprocessor Linux machine. (Parallel processing is used only in the MVN implementation via the R `parallel` library). Requires [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) and the associated `rgdal` R package.

Note that R dependencies are listed in one file, `R/install.packages.R` as mentioned above.

Publication map generation is done in R; however, models are created and saved in GeoTIFF format. I used imageMagick in a few scripts for figure production/editing.

`flowchart_main.gv` and `flowchart_preprocessing.gv` are partially complete flowcharts of code structure and can be compiled with [GraphViz](https://graphviz.org/) (as in `flowchart.sh`)
